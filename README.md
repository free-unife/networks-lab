# networks-lab
LaTeX and source code files related to "Laboratorio di reti" course in UNIFE 
(University of Ferrara), year 2014-2015.

## Status of art
All the material in this repository is "as-is", i.e: it has not yet been 
reprocessed to be clear and usable. Since there are quite a lot of files, and 
the fact that this is a repository with the least priority among all, the 
processing may take a long time.
